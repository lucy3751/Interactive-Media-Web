            I think a website is like a pebble in the ocean. Each pebble is unique as they vary in sizes and form. Each website is unique as well. They have different sizes, which are measured in pages, and they have different forms or structures. Like most pebbles, websites don't get discovered easily. The only way to find them is through links from other websites, and that usually comes from coincidence. Just like how the ocean may decide to one day grab that piece of pebble and push it to the shore, allowing someone to discover it. There are many websites in the web, just like many pebbles in the ocean. And most of the time, the waves of the ocean pushes multiple pebbles to the shore, just like how the search engine displays multiple websites at the same time. It is up to the person on the shore, or the user online to decide which pebble, or website to pick. But that doesn't mean the person can only pick one pebble. They can visit all the websites.
