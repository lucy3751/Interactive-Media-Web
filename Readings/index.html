            <!-- first question -->
            <p class="question">
                1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?
            </p>
            <!-- end of first question -->

            <!-- first question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                One of the challenge that I face is not able to explain my work properly during critique. As
                someone who is nervous to speak about their work (or speak up in class in general), I often end up not
                being
                able to explain things clearly. This often cause some misunderstanding and affects the feedback I get.
                Another challenge that I face is not knowing which feedback to follow/not follow. But I often asked
                myself
                if the feedback is related to my concept in order to decide.
                <br>
                <br>
                When it comes to giving feedback, the biggest challenge for me is not knowing what feedback to give to
                my
                peers. So often times, the feedback I give would usually end up as a compliment rather than a feedback.
                But
                through reading the article, I find that I can start by telling them what the work means in my
                perspective,
                and sometimes that may help them open up to an idea that they haven't thought of.

            <!-- second question -->
            <p class="question">
                2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?
            </p>
            <!-- end of second question -->

            <!-- second question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                Most of the time during the live critique, I am too focused on listening and taking notes of what my
                peers
                are saying so I haven't really thought of whether or not I disagree with a feedback. But after the
                critique,
                when I am looking at the notes, I ask myself if the feedback would help reinforce my concept.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are also times where I would disagree with a feedback during the live critique. I believe it is
                important to acknowledge the feedback whether I agree or disagree, so I would first thank them for their
                feedback, and then I would tell them my opinion. But I feel like most of the time I might have
                misunderstood
                their feedback, or wasn't able to see something that they saw, so I would usually restate my initial
                concept
                in order to remind them in case they forgot, and would ask them how their feedback relates to the
                concept.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sometimes for the feedbacks that I disagree with, there might still be some parts that I can take from
                it
                and incorporate it with other feedbacks to generate another feedback.

            <!-- third question -->
            <p class="question">
                3. Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?
            </p>
            <!-- end of third question -->

            <!-- third question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                It is important to receive critiques because it is what makes our work better. Often times, we become
                emotionally attached to an idea very easily, which hinders the ability for our work to improve. There
                are
                many times where others may offer ideas that we haven't think of. I think through listening to other
                people's feedbacks, we can learn about their way of thinking, which not only can help us learn how to
                critique our own work, but also help us generate more creative ideas. As the article said "A lot of art
                and
                design education is about trying stuff until you figure out what works (How To Crit)", which is
                something
                that I definitely need to work on. At the same time, listening to other people presenting their work can
                help us improve our presentation of our work as well. The same reason applies to why it is important to
                give
                critiques.

            <p class="question">
                1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is
                "better"
                than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.
            </p>
            <!-- end of first question -->

            <!-- first question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                In the article, Frank mentioned that those that are strongly believing in one or the other, are basing
                their
                opinions on aesthetics. I think we should look at it base on user experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Even though skeuomorphic design is able to replicate the analogue version of the element, I feel like
                sometimes having all those extra details would make the user hard to recognize right away what that
                element
                is.
                <br>
                <br>
                Flat design, on the other hand, because it has no depth, it is hard to differentiate what stands out.
                Especially when it comes to elements like buttons, users might not exactly know that it is a button.
                Because
                it is flat and blends along with other elements.
                <br>
                <br>
                That's why I think having a combination of both skeuo and flat is better. Using the button as an
                example, if
                there is a drop shadow underneath the flat button, the button is floating and it stands out from the
                other
                elements. At the same time, the shadow gives users a sense that it is something they can press, and when
                they press it, the shadow becomes darker, which indicates that the button got pushed down. So that can
                be
                like a feedback for the user.

                Note: through searching <a
                    href="https://99designs.ca/blog/trends/skeuomorphism-flat-design-material-design/" target="_blank">online</a>, I
                believe
                there's actually a term for the
                combination of the two: Material design (by Google).

            <p class="question">
                2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example
                from
                filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.

            <!-- second question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                A zoopraxiscope is a device that projects motion by shining light onto a disc, which are composed of a
                series of photographs. The spinning disc switches the photographs at high speeds, which animates the
                object
                (like a flip book). It is similar to modern day GIFs, which are made from series of frames/images as
                well,
                and it loops.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another medium that has inspired digital design would be a device that is similar to the zoopraxiscope -
                the

                    movie projectors</a> (maybe the zoopraxiscope is what inspired the movie
                projector?). The navigation of a webpage (the scrolling part) is very similar to the concept of the film
                projector. The long webpage document is like the long strip of film. What we see on the browser viewport
                is
                like the projected image. The scrollbar is like the shuttle (a mechanism that hooks to the holes on the
                sides of the film, to pull the film down).

            <!-- third question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                To be honest, I am not exactly sure what Frank meant by screens want flux. I interpreted flux, or change
                as
                like movement. Maybe flux is more general?
                <br>
                <br>
                Based on my interpretation, I agree with Frank. I think screens are neutral, they aren't designed to be
                exactly like analogue. They can be permanent like analogue (like a pdf document that doesn't change),
                but
                they are usually temporary (like movement/animation or other customizations that we see in most websites
                and
                software today). But these temporary features can do more than analogue. Like the example that Frank
                talked
                about in low flux - the ability to filter your spreadsheet on screen. These changes can also contribute
                to
                functionality, like using subtle animations to give feedback to the user after an interaction (as Frank
                described in medium flux). While screen is not concrete and tangible like analogue, but they try to
                compensate that with interactivity and change.

                1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?
            </p>
            <!-- end of first question -->

            <!-- first question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                Lialina believes the word "user" should not be made invisible by replacing with the general term
                "people".
                She mentioned that "being a user is the last reminder that there is, whether visible or not, a computer,
                a
                programmed system you use" (Turing Complete User). Using the word "people" also blurs the boundary
                between
                developers and users, which may cause the users to lose their data and privacy rights. In general,
                Lialina
                isn't really fond of the idea of the Invisible User and Invisible Computer, because it takes away the
                customization and ultimately, control/freedom of the users.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lialina also believes that "user" is not a bad term. To programmers and hackers, the "user" is the best
                role
                when it comes to testing a piece of software/hardware. Furthermore, based on Vanevar Bush's text that
                she
                quoted, it seems like the user is even more important that the piece of hardware itself.

            <!-- end of second question -->

            <!-- second question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                Lialina's ideal internet user is the General Purpose Users. The General Purpose Users are users who
                basically have many ways to achieve one task, instead of just following the way they are designed to be
                done
                by developers. This way, users are more engaged with the hardware and software, which aligns with what
                the
                web 2.0 is designed for, which encourages people to contribute, and establishing personal connections
                between the builder and the consumer of the app. These connections can be established by as Liliana
                called
                it "filling the gaps", which I believe refers to filling up the features that were not implemented by
                the
                builders.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lialina also mentioned how users were often thought of as being too busy, and the computer was a tool
                for
                them to perform their repetitive thoughts so they can save their brain power for something else.
                However,
                when all technology are designed based on this notion, every task become automated to the point where
                the
                user is not busy anymore, and it eventually robs them away from their creative freedom.
                <br>
                <br>
                The General Purpose Users are also known as Universal or Turing Complete Users, because like Alan
                Turing's
                Universal Machine, where it can solve any logical problem given enough time and memory, the General
                Purpose
                Users can achieve anything as long as there is enough time.

                3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be
                filled

            </p>
            <!-- end of third question -->

            <!-- third question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                From my own experience with the web, an example of "filling the gaps" can be for OneNote, there isn't a
                built in calendar/agenda function, so I drew my own calendars using the table function. I can use other
                calendar apps, but because they all required making an account and being someone who forgets things
                easily,
                I choose not to.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another example can be for Instagram. I really hope they can implement a feature where users can filter
                out
                what type of content appear on their homepage. I often wanted to see work from the designers I followed,
                but
                I ended up getting distracted by a photo of food when I scrolled down to see the next post. As a way to
                get
                around that, I created multiple Instagram accounts, one for design, and the other for personal. But as I
                become interested in other content, I might have to create many Instagram accounts.

            <!-- first question -->
            <p class="question">
                1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her?
                Please
                explain your answer.

            <!-- first question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media because the idea of having the web
                controlled by
                a few large dominating corporations isn't what the web really is about. She said the web is "an
                interconnected web of individual nodes supporting a vast network" (My website is a shifting house next
                to a
                river of knowledge. What could yours be?). We need to expand the web further so that it truly represents
                what its metaphor refers to, and so that it lives up to its name of the "world wide web". Schwulst also
                talked about how large social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Pinterest care about
                profit
                first before its users' needs.
                <br>
                <br>
                I agree with Schwulst. Even though we have accounts in social media, but at the end of the day, we don't
                actually have full control over them. But when we create our own websites, we have full control. We can
                customize how we exactly envision our website to be. In a way, the web is like the digital version of
                our
                world if we have individual websites. Those individual website(s) represent our individual self, our own
                thoughts and imaginations. This is what Tim Berners Lee wanted, for the web to "reflect our hopes and
                fulfil
                our dreams" (My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?). Having
                everyone's profiles fall under a template in social media really takes away the uniqueness in ourselves.
                <br>
                <br>
                But considering the web right now, where a lot of its users come from social media platforms, it might
                be
                very hard to reshape the web into what Schwulst is advocating for. Take Twitter for example, many new
                users
                would most likely prefer to tweet on Twitter because there is already a huge established audience in
                Twitter. If they were to tweet on their own website, users might not be able to find it, so there isn't
                that
                much engagement.

            <p class="question">
                2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a
                paragraph
                describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend
                that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.

            <!-- second question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                I think a website is like a pebble in the ocean. Each pebble is unique as they vary in sizes and form.
                Each
                website is unique as well. They have different sizes, which are measured in pages, and they have
                different
                forms or structures. Like most pebbles, websites don't get discovered easily. The only way to find them
                is
                through links from other websites, and that usually comes from coincidence. Just like how the ocean may
                decide to one day grab that piece of pebble and push it to the shore, allowing someone to discover it.
                There
                are many websites in the web, just like many pebbles in the ocean. And most of the time, the waves of
                the
                ocean pushes multiple pebbles to the shore, just like how the search engine displays multiple websites
                at
                the same time. It is up to the person on the shore, or the user online to decide which pebble, or
                website to
                pick. But that doesn't mean the person can only pick one pebble. They can visit all the websites.

            <!-- third question -->
            <p class="question">
                3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be
                filled
                by users"?
            </p>
            <!-- end of third question -->

            <!-- third question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                From my own experience with the web, an example of "filling the gaps" can be for OneNote, there isn't a
                built in calendar/agenda function, so I drew my own calendars using the table function. I can use other
                calendar apps, but because they all required making an account and being someone who forgets things
                easily,
                I choose not to.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another example can be for Instagram. I really hope they can implement a feature where users can filter
                out
                what type of content appear on their homepage. I often wanted to see work from the designers I followed,
                but
                I ended up getting distracted by a photo of food when I scrolled down to see the next post. As a way to
                get
                around that, I created multiple Instagram accounts, one for design, and the other for personal. But as I
                become interested in other content, I might have to create many Instagram accounts.

            <!-- first question -->
            <p class="question">
                1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our
                tools.'
                What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word
                poetry?
            </p>
            <!-- end of first question -->

            <!-- first question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                In the opening paragraph, Seu writes "Most use their devices in an automated way, without reflecting on
                their gestures" (The Poetry of Tools). I think Seu is referring about how especially in today's age
                where
                technology has advanced a lot (to the point where it seems "flawless"), a lot of users don't really pay
                much
                attention to how the technology actually works, and how their gestures impact that piece of technology.
                So I
                think when Seu is telling us to join her to "defamiliarize our tools", she is telling us to think
                consciously about the technology - to think more and engage deeply about it, rather than just scrolling
                and
                clicking to get from one goal to another.
                <br>
                <br>
                Seu also gave new identities to the mundane screen and the cursor that we see everyday. She described
                how
                the audience is the person on the "other side of this glass screen" (The Poetry of Tools), and the mouse
                is
                her "avatar". This is similar to poetry, where a lot of the times poets would explain the ordinary in a
                very
                unordinary and new perspective, which allows us to see the world in a different point of view.

            <!-- second question -->
            <p class="question">
                2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works,
                Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one
                of
                these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned
                in
                her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.

            <!-- second question answer -->
            <p class="answer">
                For "Slow Growth & Slow Death", I interpreted it as Seu implying that like nature and human beings, the
                web
                is a living thing as well, since it can slowly grow and eventually die.
                <br>
                <br>
                Seu's example of Penelope Umrico's All the Catalogs (A-Z) reminds me of the <a
                    href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>, which can be can be an example of "Slow Growth
                &
                Slow Death". It shows historic snapshots
                of websites. Through looking back in time, you can definitely identify the slow growth of the website
                from
                its change in features, and the interface. Often times, some webpage of the website either gets deleted,
                or
                the whole website gets replaced by another website (that brought the domain). I think this represents
                the
                "death" of the website. I feel like the state of the website can also reflect the creator themselves
                behind
                the website. Take a company website for example, the change in interface over periods of time can
                represent
                the company growth slowly, and the "death" of the website can represent the disband/end of the company.
