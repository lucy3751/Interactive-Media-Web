            <h2>What I learned in this course:</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>CSS Grid</strong>
                <br>
                CSS Grid
                I remember in the beginning of the course, I already felt intimidated when seeing these two things
                written in the course outline. I've tried to used the CSS grid before, but immediately gave up after all
                the technical difficulties and turn back to flex box.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Responsive</strong>
                <br>
                I think making the website responsive was the most challenging and what I spend the most time on in this
                course.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>jQuery, p5.js, and JavaScript</strong>
                <br>
                This course allowed me to polish my skills on JavaScript, especially p5.js. I already had some
                experience with it before this course. But this time, I learned beyond just drawing shapes on the canvas
                - I learned to move the shapes and add interactions, something that I never knew was possible with
                p5.js!
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Workflow - Wireframe, then develop</strong>
                <br>
                Before this course, I would always do a very rough sketch on paper and then head straight to code. I
                thought drawing the high fidelity wireframe would waste time, but I was wrong!
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Design and Technical Abilities</strong>
                <br>
                I think my coding limitations also helped push my creativity as a designer. Often times, I come up with
                an idea, but during the development stage I am unable to achieve that due to technical problems, so I
                have to find another design solution.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h2 class="new-subheading">Overall</h2>
            <p>
                This course helped me changed the way I think about the web. I originally thought the web was just a tool for users to exchange information to each other. But there's more than that! It doesn't have to be just text and some images (like a pdf), there can also be interactions that makes the browsing experience more interesting. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I really wish this course was longer (expanding into the Summer semester) because I really wanted to learn about API and servers (in ACT III). Despite that, it was still a very fun course! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thank you for an awesome semester!
            </p>
